# Pianist-Identification-System-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Musical performers impart their unique artistry to each composition, resulting in distinctive styles. This inherent singularity has driven research into computational models focusing on performer identification


## Datasets
In this study, we used piano MIDI performances from the ATEPP dataset. However, we have also made attempts on this task with the following datasets:

### Maestro-v3.0.0 with performer information
The MAESTRO dataset does not provide information about performers for each performance
